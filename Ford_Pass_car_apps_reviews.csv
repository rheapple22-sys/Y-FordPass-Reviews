FordPass,"Charging the car with my Zappi is a nightmare! Octopus Intelligent Go is simply unsustainable, and Octopus Go extremely temperamental! The Zappi has even been replaced and works fine, and there is nothing inherently wrong with my power supply, or Octopus.

However, the same charger and setup previously worked perfectly with two other EVs from Mazda and Omoda respectively. So WHERE's the problem?",2026-02-04 07:53:45,1,6.5.0,0

FordPass,The Lightning is an excellent truck. Power has constantly been better than the ICE trucks I have owned. I have not tested the Lightning on an extended trip while pulling a heavy load because of the scarcity of public fast chargers in our area. The only downside I have experienced is discrepancy with projected and actual range. The best part is our home solar system charges both our EVs and home resulting in $0 electrical bill.,2026-01-19 22:33:52,5,6.0.0,0

FordPass,"App is almost useless. When viewing the vehicle status, it just says ""Parked"". There is no indication as to whether it's locked or unlocked. That would be helpful.

FordPass,This app is bad before and worse since they updated it. On my Lightning it still says parked instead of saying locked or unlocked. You have to refresh the app to see if the truck is going to charge at its scheduled time when you plug in the charger. Trying to change the target charge level doesn't work. Ford still forces you to charge at a location first before you can set a charging schedule. Vehicle location is very slow to update as in 1-2 hours later it will show where the truck is.,2025-11-12 06:45:57,2,6.1.0,11

FordPass,The app works pretty well for the most part. It is missing the extremely basic feature of scheduling a journey from the app. most other EVs have this and having to do it in vehicle is inconvenient. Really needs to be sorted out. trip scheduling is a convenience feature which isn't very convenient if you have to do it in vehicle. With this feature it would be a 4 or 5 star app for me.,2025-10-17 15:42:36,3,1.12.1,0

FordPass,app is good as no glitches etc. Just needs more features as you should be able to do most things on your phone as you can on the screen mainly the battery warmer as shouldnt need to go out a turn it on in the car or have a timer to set it to come on and adjust the charging percentage. So just more features that can be controlled by your phone would be great,2025-10-05 12:40:14,2,,0

Another very very cool function could be too be able to view the cameras at any time, or at least take and receive a screen cap.",2025-07-02 05:36:01,3,5.21.0,3

FordPass,"Why do they make these apps with expiring login tokens? I've had the app on my phone for 7 months and haven't needed to login. And now it forces me without any warning. What security is added by this? Like, if someone stole my phone three months ago, they still would have all that time to access my vehicle (if they could bypass my phone's security, which they can't). There's a 100% chance I would wipe my phone memory anyway. This doesn't enhance security, only inconvenience.",2025-06-20 09:14:42,1,5.21.0,1

FordPass,"The Ford app is functional and does what it needs to do, but it’s neither polished nor complete; e.g., often, when you press a button in the app, the button doesn’t change colour to indicate that it has been pressed, even though the action is being processed. IMHO, the root cause of the app’s troubles is that the Agile Product Owner isn’t also a user of the app (i.e., the Product Owner is someone who isn’t paid enough money to be able to afford a Ford vehicle that uses the app).",2025-06-04 19:20:08,3,5.20.0,0

FordPass,"some improvements to charging like it doesn't fail 22/25 attempts now. but every single update they break something. now it's plug and charge. I turned it off in the app so I could use an EA charger with a discount instead of paying full price thru Ford. Go to turn back on plug and charge, well joke is on the customers. not charging won't turn on. charging it won't turn on. turn it on from the sync 4/4a settings somewhere haha nope. doesn't even exist. oh and vehicle service history also broken",2025-05-10 02:15:32,2,5.18.0,2

FordPass,"Update: increased rating to 3. Ford has made improvements but still spotty issues. I love my 2023 F150 Lightning but 1) PAK needs improvement. Hold to lock unlock start rarely works, when there is full signal and am close to truck, so holding those buttons down for 3 sec is a terrible idea. 2) Doesn’t sense the vehicle when you’re within a few feet and has no walk away locking. 3) Doesn’t let you change battery charging % 4) Especially for EVs, figure out screen ease of Use.

FordPass,The worst experience from a technological stand point. A huge safety issue and inconvenience is the integration of the Charge Station Pro. I set the Charge rate to 12 Amps in this app. Truck pulling 13k. HOW? I need to control the charging amps on my vehicle. I have 3 EV's and sometimes they all need to charge. Also you cannot control the Rate when you have no internet. FCSP rate settings should be in the FCSP app and able to be controlled with Bluetooth as a backup. Totally unacceptable/unsafe,2025-04-12 00:48:53,1,,0

FordPass,"I absolutely love this app. It is so informative. My daughter wrecked my car, and the app informed me of everything that needed to be fixed. The app also was letting me know what was removed from the vehicle as they were fixing it. I would call the shop and ask them when they would replace what was revealed to me on the app , I was sounding like a real mechanic, lol. It's also convenient for a quick run to the car,and you forget your keys and start your car in the winter through your phone",2025-03-30 04:59:23,5,5.14.0,43

For the latest version some clown obviously decided to leave it off the app. So I and no doubt many others now have no access to a handbook. Ford's it's high time you corrected this oversight. I am now told that it was removed to stabilise the app. If the app wasn't stable there was clearly more work to do on it so why were handbooks not paper printed meantime?,2025-02-14 19:04:33,2,5.12.0,0

FordPass,app was originally awesome. after updates it's nearly useless. can't charge anything in the van with the keys on and locked with the app or it will Lock You Out of your own car and say it's for safety when your the only one with access on the app... also can't remote start 90 percent of the time I'm out on jobs or on call at night as it says it's conserving the battery until I start the van again. this is daily when driven daily and battery is fine. I'm sure we'll blame thieves for bad design,2025-01-28 17:50:25,2,5.10.1,6

FordPass,"STOP ""FIXING"" THINGS THAT AREN'T BROKEN. If I could give negative stars I would. The latest update to ""improve"" connectivity somehow made it worse- app will no longer communicate with my vehicles. Every update the remote start function gets worse and error messages get more frequent. Change for the sake of change and random unneeded features aren't necessary or even wanted. Just make the app work at performing the basic functions it needs to- lock, unlock, remote start. It's not that hard.",2024-12-17 00:45:42,1,5.9.0,62

Nu mai are nimic intuitiv în ea, de exemplu cum vezi presiunea în roți sau ce atenționari există? Trebuie să cauți prin setări meniu.

FordPass,This current version/layout is useless. It doesn't provide as much information as before. Change it back.,2024-11-06 16:40:17,1,5.7.0,1
FordPass,"The last update is a little bit better. The locking controls are now available for the new Explorer EV. Though, the vehicle health is now showing as unavailable. So, no tire pressure in the app yet. Also, the quick manual of the new Ford Explorer EV states that the full manual can be found in the app. This is not the case. I hope you'll add more features soon. I would really like more control over charging and get insights in the kWh consumption statistics.",2024-11-06 16:22:09,3,5.7.0,12
