FordPass,I've worked out why the app on my S24 disconects from my ford ranger....I only drive it twice a week ... it's a system battery saver.. protection..

FordPass,"The app is great and nice features that are useful such as knowing the gas left in the vehicle, tire pressure, opening and closing the car, starting the car remotely. These are features that I love also having the owners manual there. The reason for my 3 stars is that I wish Ford would update their app so that when you close the phone and look at the app again it wouldn't say ""Temporarily Unavailable"". It happens every time you lock your phone and look at it again. Everything else is amazing.",2025-08-14 22:14:47,3,5.25.0,7
FordPass,"1. Very difficult to find where to order parts. 2. ""How To"" videos only go back to car models 9 years ago. 3.

Text notifications say parts are in but parts are not found at the dealership.",2025-08-14 20:04:23,1,5.25.0,6
FordPass,"Very disappointing app for our new Maverick when compared to other apps like Hyundai's or Mazda's. The basics are not even there. It doesn't even tell you if the vehicle is locked or not, if a door is properly closed or not. It would be nice to have the status of the vehicle at least. If you check something else on your phone and go back to your app, it says that it's temporarily unavailable and you have to close the app and reopen it. Hopefully new updates will make this app better.",2025-08-14 19:59:38,2,5.25.0,0

I was finally forced to downgrade to the miserable 5 series app that's stupid and ugly.Every two weeks (exactly) it decides my 6.7L F-350 has low batteries mode if I don't start it and cuts off the telemetry. This is never happened with 4.37 and it's not real. I keep a 30W MPPT solar charger on it. My own BMS shows the batteries are always fully charged.",2025-07-12 02:24:06,1,5.23.0,7

FordPass,This app needs someone to actually test it before releasing to the public. There are issues when pressing the back button and expecting to go back one screen/page but instead it goes back to where you first started. This happens consistently when viewing the manual.

It would be nice if it actually showed if my car was currently locked so I wouldn't have to wonder if I forgot to lock it. Another issue is the fact that there is no picture of one of my cars. After calling to see if they can fix this, they said it could not be corrected. ????

FordPass,They took away the things people actually use in the app. The app is now just a key fob. No longer can you control zone lighting or enter service records to stay good with the ESP.

FordPass,"it's a very basic app, I've just switched from Volvo and the features it has compared to Ford. surprised that Ford haven't spent more time on the app and making it worthwhile. maybe they need to check out the competition and see what others are doing to help inspire them.",2025-05-11 17:00:46,2,5.18.0,0
FordPass,"This app is good, but only as good as the information fed to it.

The vehicle is coming up to 4yrs old now but the system still doesn't recognise my second Reg. The vehicle has had its first MOT and a few services since the change and I'm assured by my dealer that they have updated the system, but your app still won't recognise the Reg. which is OO 5086",2025-05-11 14:31:16,5,5.18.0,0

FordPass,"some improvements to charging like it doesn't fail 22/25 attempts now. but every single update they break something. now it's plug and charge. I turned it off in the app so I could use an EA charger with a discount instead of paying full price thru Ford.

FordPass,"Update: increased rating to 3. Ford has made improvements but still spotty issues. I love my 2023 F150 Lightning but 1) PAK needs improvement. Hold to lock unlock start rarely works, when there is full signal and am close to truck, so holding those buttons down for 3 sec is a terrible idea. 2) Doesn’t sense the vehicle when you’re within a few feet and has no walk away locking. 3) Doesn’t let you change battery charging % 4) Especially for EVs, figure out screen ease of Use. Tesla did.",2025-05-10 00:34:50,3,5.18.0,3

FordPass,"No where near as good as the original Ford Pass Pro that was inexplicably ditched. But it does a job. However, why doesn't the app tell you if your vehicle is Locked or not? Just the 2 buttons with no way to tell. And why doesn't the service screen show you all the fluid levels and other indications the old Pro did. FordPass Pro was excellent FordPass is mediocre in comparison. Heck I'd pay for Pro if it meant getting it back.",2025-05-09 17:20:44,2,5.18.0,5

Plus, it alerts you if the alarm goes off and shows your car’s location on GPS, which is helpful when you forget where you park.

Also you cannot control the Rate when you have no internet. FCSP rate settings should be in the FCSP app and able to be controlled with Bluetooth as a backup.

Tesla,Update - I fixed the battery drain by turning off UWB feature on my phone. And the crashing can be fixed by clearing cache periodically. Also make sure to disable rear trunk auto opening feature as it leverages UWB I think,2025-04-28 01:05:43,3,,1

Tesla,"It's great for using with the car but it's extremely disappointing how far behind the android version is compared to the IOS.

Tesla,"A lot of things could be done better. Ability to schedule charging is VERY limited, and not well coordinated between the car and the wall connector. I do like that the wall connector page encourages scheduling during off-peak or ""discount"" times, BUT it only recognizes one time window.

Tesla,The best and only app for your Tesla. Got the 2024 Model Y a few weeks ago and installed this app prior to the delivery. All communication with Tesla reps were done through this app. Flawless experience with the delivery. Now I understand why people hate other auto dealers. Controlling your Tesla with this app is another fantastic experience. Remote climate control and camera from any location. You can also use this app like Google maps and send locations to the car.

Tesla,It works well. Allows to set up the car before riding it and controll it remotely. In my opinion it is missing some easy to implement features to become 5star: - Choose minimum battery load during trip. - Choose battery load at destination. - Add non-tesla charging stations to trip (there are countries where there are not enough Tesla stations and I need to be able to use others easily) - Battery preconditioning for non-Tesla fast chargers.,2024-08-19 21:05:08,4,4.35.5-2775,6

Tesla,"Used this app for over a year, at first, it worked fine. I can no longer trust the app to keep the settings such as 50% powerwall reserve, it keeps reverting to 25% reserve. Secondly, I've caught the app charging from the grid when I had more than the reserve available and no ""storm watch""(it's disabled).

Tesla,We have solar panels through Sunrun with a Tesla Powerwall to use power after sundown and as a backup power. The app to monitor the system from Sunrun is absolutely horrid and not real time. The Tesla app is great for what we have and helped prove to Sunrun the system was not producing proper power. Also like the storm watch feature that makes adjustments to the system when a storm is forecast. I would like to suggest a place to add a scheduled power outage to work similarly as storm watch.,2024-08-02 04:10:23,4,4.35.1-2745,1

I already gave that info. For charging schedule, you can only set start or end time. And the costs don't include utility taxes. Lastly, p",2024-06-25 04:39:47,2,4.33.5-2673,1

GM,"I've had a mostly reasonable experience with the app so far. Recently, my car has not been pushing updates about charge status, unless it's ""running"". The main issue for me is the removal of charging speed for level 1, I used to be able to change from 8 amp to 12, but at some point that was removed, since I have a 2022 Bolt EUV, that more or less removed the main functionality of the app for me. It still works for charge status, Sometimes. The route planner is awful + no climate controls",2025-08-11 21:18:32,3,7.14.0,0

GM,I dislike the new update. It removed my ability to switch from 8 to 12 amp remotely and removed the option to finish charging by a certain time. The stop charging would be a nice addition if you could start it again from the app. I really wish they would add a feature to charge between certain times and to start charging again from the app. The only use for this app now is to see what battery percentage your car has.,2025-04-13 06:19:43,2,7.6.0,21

GM,"More like 3.5 stars. In my case the app doesn't crash. It takes long to start (3 to 4 minutes!), then it's ok. However, it doesn't really add much value. The only valuable feature, is the possibility of Starting the engine. The previous version of this app was much better: it had the same features as now. But it would also summarize each individual trip (even mapping it). One could see detailed info of gas consumption, performance, etc. This feature is gone now",2025-03-29 21:37:22,3,,0

GM,Worst app I've ever used Love my truck but this app and the connectivity to the vehicle/onstar/Android Auto is all but worthless and a hassle. Multiple updates and reconnection /re-registration with the vehicle needed per year. Tech support does their job and even acknowledges the sub par coding. If. My truck ever to have a breakdown or be stolen the app WOULD BE USELESS. CHEVY needs to improve on this or I'm going with FORD in 5 years.,2025-03-28 13:18:52,1,7.4.0 (4461),0

GM,App rarely ever works. It takes ages for it to load up. It first has to load up and determine if your phone is a trusted device. Then if you use the map locate feature it has to do another load. If you minimize the app it has to repeat it all over. Sometimes you get stuck on the startup screen where it says mychevrolet until your phone times it out for no response.

Everything is working on the app but I can't change charge mode or tell the car to precondition for a certain departure time.

It may or may not have worked, regardless of whether it says a command went through, it often doesn't... but it will still say it worked. Edit: Followed advice, and it's worse. The charging section will allow you to choose a nearby charger and navigate to it, but it'll send you for miles into the middle of a random road... and no charger.",2024-10-03 10:47:21,1,7.0.0 (4367),56
GM,"Was sufficient. Not great, but functional. However, the recent update broke the app. It will no longer open.",2024-10-03 10:01:53,1,7.0.0 (4367),1

GM,"This app is good, but the map section can no longer locate anything. I tried restarting the phone, uninstalling the app, and then reinstalling it. It worked fine for a few days, but now it's glitching again. Update: The glitch is fixed thankfully 🙌🏽🙌🏽 Please keep it that way 🙏🏽🙏🏽",2024-10-03 05:35:38,5,,0

GM,Can't unlock car with this. Also old app had account area where you could lock unlock doors. Not this one. ALSO having to enter security code every damn time you log in is ridiculous. No thief is gonna figure out my phone passcode nor will they take the time to unlock the doors remotely. PLEASE get rid of the repetitive security code. I want to get in with just my password. The KIA brats don't bother stealing Chevy Trax's. Make the app more streamlined PLEASE,2024-10-03 03:21:46,1,7.0.0 (4367),1
GM,App came in super handy. I locked my keys in my car but still had my phone. Signed into the app and was able to unlock my car. Nice!,2024-10-03 02:03:40,5,7.0.0 (4367),0

GM,"Worked great for over a year but since September 9, 2024 the app will not open. Message says stopped working. Have tried everything several times. Onstar rep had no clue. Frustrating...update 10/02/2024. Still not working. GM techs notified me about it 2 weeks ago and said they have people working on it and would let me know when it gets fixed. Not a word. Disappointed in this high tech company..",2024-10-02 23:17:44,1,,1

GM,"Will not open. Tried as they said most useless app I have tried to install. Gm and onstar take $, but can not give your money's worth. When buying a gm onstar is in the price stealing from our pockets. GM has stupid answers to problems. Just give me the $3000 you took for onstar, and I'll be happy. The price of vehicles is inflated by 50% . AND GM SOLD OUT AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL CARS ARE MADE IN MEXICO AND TRAX, KOREA. WHER IS APP PRODUCED???????????",2024-10-02 18:43:07,1,7.0.0 (4367),1
